                    <p><strong>Airport Transfers</strong></p>
                    <p>1st Classic Transportation provides rates by distance (miles), and time for most domestic commercial airport pickups and drop-offs involving most major airports and metropolitan areas across our coverage hours. The commercial airport transfer rate is based upon a pickup and drop-off without any associated delay or waiting time exceeding fifteen (15) minutes. Your vehicle is dispatched according to the flight&rsquo;s estimated time of arrival as provided to 1st Classic Transportation by FAA data and/or each respective airline&rsquo;s automated system (1st Classic Transportation is not responsible for delays caused by the airline&rsquo;s automated system or otherwise). For airport departure transfers (to the airport), billing shall revert to the prevailing hourly rate in the event the client is delayed, or the waiting time is exceeded, beyond the allotted fifteen (15) minutes. For arrivals transfers (from the airport), billing shall revert to the prevailing hourly rate in the event the flight is delayed, or the waiting time is exceeded the allotted (30) minutes, unless your arrival flight number changes, and we must be notified immediately in advance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Point to Point Transfers</strong></p>
                    <p>1st Classic Transportation may provide point-to-point transfer rates for local pickups and drop-offs within the immediate Kansas City service area.  Wait time beyond the fifteen (15) minute &ldquo;grace&rdquo; period as well as for extra stops or indirect routing are charged additional, or charges may revert to the prevailing hourly rate. Transfer rates are a function of time, distance, and zone locations.  Off-hour and holiday fees may apply.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hourly Service</strong></p>
                    <p>1st Classic Transportation provides an hourly rate for all other services based on a two (3) hour or more minimum charge, depending on vehicle type.  Hourly or &ldquo;As Directed&rdquo; services allow for multiple stops and wait times as directed by the client.  The vehicle will stay with the client or at their stop locations (as parking availability allows) for the entire rental time.  Travel time may be charged on a &ldquo;garage-to-garage&rdquo; basis and is made a part of the respective hourly minimums.</p>

A full fare, including a 20% chauffeur gratuity will be billed to the credit card on file for cancellation received less than 72 hours before the scheduled pickup time.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Shows</strong></p>
                    <p>If you do not see your chauffeur, please call our office immediately at +1 (800) 658-5679 to avoid the full-charge &ldquo;no-show&rdquo; fee. </p>
                    <p>A full fare, including a 20% chauffeur gratuity will be billed if passengers fail to be at the designated pickup location (No-show).
